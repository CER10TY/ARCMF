# ARCOMM Mission Framework
Our mission framework is an adaptation of the [F3 framework](https://github.com/ferstaberinde/F3) created by [Ferstaberinde](https://github.com/ferstaberinde). It is designed to be robust, easily customisable and open for expansion. For some documentation on how to add custom functions and the basics of SQF scripting, head over to the [documentation page here](https://github.com/ARCOMM/ARC_MF.VR/wiki/Documentation). For tutorials on how to create your first mission from start to finish head over to the [tutorials page here](https://github.com/ARCOMM/ARC_MF.VR/wiki/Tutorials).

This is a custom fork that uses Bundeswehr Gear (G36KA1 etc) instead of the default US Army Gear.
